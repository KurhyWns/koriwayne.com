## About This Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in **DevSecOps** and **GitOps** methodologies, showcasing projects that integrate security throughout the entire software development lifecycle:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** implementations with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines with automated security scanning
- **Security-first development** practices with comprehensive quality gates
- **Automated testing and validation** including secrets detection and code quality checks
- **GitOps workflows** for reliable deployments with branch protection
- **Container orchestration** and microservices architecture with security validation
- **Compliance and governance** automation with infrastructure security scanning

## Security & Quality Pipeline

This repository implements a comprehensive security and quality pipeline that runs on every pull request:

### üîí **Secrets Detection**
- **TruffleHog OSS**: Scans for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **GitLeaks**: Detects secrets in git history
- **detect-secrets**: Baseline-based secret detection

### üêç **Code Quality**
- **Black**: Python code formatting
- **isort**: Import statement sorting
- **Flake8**: Python linting and style checking
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **Bandit**: Security linting for Python
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### üìù **Documentation**
- **markdownlint**: Markdown file linting
- **yamllint**: YAML file validation
- **MkDocs**: Documentation build testing
- **linkchecker**: Broken link detection

### üê≥ **Infrastructure Security**
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile best practices and security
- **kubeval**: Kubernetes manifest validation
- **kube-score**: Kubernetes security and best practices
- **Helm**: Helm chart linting
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure code linting and formatting

Each project demonstrates practical applications of DevSecOps principles, showing how security is integrated throughout the entire software development lifecycle rather than being an afterthought.
