## About This Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in **DevSecOps** and **GitOps** methodologies, showcasing projects that integrate security throughout the entire software development lifecycle:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** implementations
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines
- **Security-first development** practices
- **Automated testing and validation**
- **GitOps workflows** for reliable deployments
- **Container orchestration** and microservices architecture
- **Compliance and governance** automation

Each project demonstrates practical applications of DevSecOps principles, showing how security is integrated throughout the entire software development lifecycle rather than being an afterthought.
